# LockPort

## How it works:

- You must be in a raid group.
- If someone types 123 or Summon in Say, Yell, Whisper, Party, Raid, or Raid Leader the Playername gets added to the LockPort list and is synced accros all LockPort users.
- SHIFT + leftclick to move the frame.
- Type /lp or /LockPort to show or hide the LockPort Window.  
- Left click to Summon.
- CTRL + Left click to target the player.
- Right click to remove.
- If no player is on the list the frame is hidden again (type /lp or /LockPort to manually show).

Options:
/lp help
/lp zone(enabled/disables zoneinfo in /w and /ra)
/lp whispers (enabled/disables whispering the target)
