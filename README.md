# LockPort

## How it works:

- You must be in a raid group.
- If someone types 123 or Summon in Say, Yell, Whisper, Party, Raid, or Raid Leader the Playername gets added to the LockPort list and is synced accros all LockPort users. Any user added to the list will also trigger a sound alert to let the Warlocks know someone is on the list (Sound is subject to change). 
- SHIFT + leftclick to move the frame.
- Type /lp or /LockPort to show or hide the LockPort Window.  
- Left click to Summon.
- CTRL + Left click to target the player.
- Right click to remove.
- If no player is on the list the frame is hidden again (type /lp or /LockPort to manually show).

Options:

- /lp help - Shows commands in chat. 
- /lp zone - Enables or Disables including Zone information in summoning messages.
- /lp whispers - Enables or Disables whispering the target when summoning.
